# serverless function

this type of function is to use cloud computing to show results , without having actual physical servers, we used "Vercel" to hold our code. we wrote our code on js , then we pushed it to our github account , then we linked our github account with vercel and created a new project there. 

we used parseing to send string from the url and use inside the coded as response.
